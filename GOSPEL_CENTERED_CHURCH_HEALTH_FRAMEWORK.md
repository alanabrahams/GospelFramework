# The Gospel-Centered Church Health Framework

---

## Introduction

The Gospel is not the ABCs of our individual and church lives — it is the A to Z.

It is not merely the doorway into faith, but the pathway, and power for everything the church is and does.

This Gospel-Centered Church Health Framework is built on the conviction that when the Gospel of grace is truly at the center, everything else finds its right order — worship is renewed, disciples are formed, leaders are humbled and empowered, and mission becomes a joyful overflow of love. Ultimately as more such Gospel-centered churches are planted and flourish, cities are renewed through a Gospel Movement.

This framework is not a scorecard. It is a mirror of grace — a way of asking, "Is the Gospel beautiful and believable among us…in our church and in our culture?"

This framework helps a church look honestly at both its roots and its fruit: the roots being Gospel depth — Scripture, prayer, and worship; the fruit being Gospel witness — faith & work, mercy & justice, generosity, and mission to the city.

Healthy churches are not driven by performance or pride, but by a deep awareness of grace that produces humility, unity, and compassion.

This framework journeys through three great Gospel movements:

1. **Worship** — where hearts are re-centered on God's glory and grace.
2. **Discipleship & Leadership Development** — where lives are reshaped by the Gospel's logic of grace before performance.
3. **Mission** — where the church turns outward in love toward the city, engaging culture, work, and the brokenness of the world with Gospel hope.

This is a city-facing, movemental vision. The Gospel does not make us retreat from the world but sends us into it — into neighborhoods, workplaces, and cultural spaces — to live as a counterculture for the common good.

A Gospel-centered church not only prioritises ongoing renewal within, but as an outflow of this, also cares deeply about the poor, thinks deeply about vocation, and partners joyfully with other churches and ministries. It seeks not just to grow its own attendance, but to see the city renewed by the grace of Christ.

Inwardly, this framework calls for a renewed awe before the Gospel — a rediscovery of joy in Scripture, worship, and prayer. Outwardly, it calls for a renewed engagement with the city — a passion to see the good news of Jesus heal what is broken in culture, relationships, and institutions.

When both movements — inward renewal and outward mission — flow together, the church becomes a living, multiplying community of grace that loves its city to life.

## How to Use the Gospel-Centered Church Health Framework

We encourage churches to sit with their leadership teams, prayerfully reflecting on each area of this framework. Leaders should ask: How is our church doing? Where are we flourishing in the Gospel, and where do we need more renewal? What could we do differently to help our members grow in Christ and reach our city more effectively?

This reflection is meant to be a shared spiritual exercise, not just an administrative audit — a space to align hearts and minds around God's vision for the church.

So this assessment asks not just, "How are we doing as a church?" but "Is the Gospel shaping everything?"

If the answer is yes — even imperfectly, even in weakness — then we are not just growing a church, we are joining God in His great work of renewing people, places, and the world through the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

You will see that there are twin tracks that gently guide you through this healthy church assessment framework.

**In the first track** you will be encouraged to reflect on the true health of the church God has called you to lead.

**In the second track** you will be guided to look into your own heart as a leader.

We need the second track too because ministry can and does so easily become an idol.

It's tempting to measure worth by attendance, influence, or program success. When that happens, ministry becomes performance, and the heart grows weary.

The second track invites leaders to pause and let the Gospel cut deep. They ask: Am I resting in Christ's grace, or am I striving to prove my value? Am I leading from sonship or from fear or self-reliance?

True fruitfulness flows from a Gospel-shaped heart. When leaders embrace their identity in Christ, they lead with humility, freedom, and joy — modeling the Gospel for the whole church and together, healthy churches model the Gospel to the city.

---

## SECTION ONE: WORSHIP

### 1) Scripture as Authority and Centrality of the Gospel

#### 1.1 Is Scripture viewed as the inerrant Word of God and used as the absolute standard for faith and practice?

**Rating Scale:**

1. **Cultural pressures dominate:** Scripture is often ignored or overridden by popular opinion, personal preference, or cultural trends; faith and practice follow the world rather than God's Word.

2. **Inconsistent engagement with Scripture:** Leaders and members recognize Scripture's authority in theory, but its guidance is applied sporadically, inconsistently, or selectively.

3. **Scripture mostly governs life:** The Bible is regularly read and referenced; leaders and members generally try to obey it, but application is often functional or moralistic rather than Gospel-driven.

4. **Scripture as power for transformation:** Leaders and many members celebrate Scripture's truth, goodness, and power; God's Word shapes hearts and minds, producing repentance, faith, and Gospel-centered growth.

5. **Scripture saturates life and mission:** Scripture is deeply understood and applied by most members; it governs every aspect of church life, ministry, and personal transformation, guiding inward holiness and outward mission, with the Gospel as the lens for all obedience.

**Leader Self-Reflection Question:**
> How is the Gospel shaping the way I read, preach, and obey Scripture in my own life? Am I relying more on God's grace or am I striving in my flesh?

---

#### 1.2 Is there a general understanding that the Gospel is the grand and central theme of the Bible?

**Rating Scale:**

1. **Minimal awareness:** Less than 10% of members understand the Gospel's centrality; most read Scripture without seeing Christ or the power of grace.

2. **Introduced but not embodied:** The concept has been taught, but members struggle to see how the Gospel shapes their hearts, obedience, or daily life.

3. **Growing understanding and practice:** Most members recognize the Gospel as central; they apply it to their repentance, faith, and spiritual growth.

4. **Gospel integrated in teaching and culture:** The church consistently communicates the Gospel in preaching, small groups, and personal study; new members quickly grasp it and see Christ in all Scripture.

5. **Gospel-saturated lives:** Members not only articulate the Gospel clearly but live under its power daily, seeing Christ and grace woven through every passage of Scripture, allowing it to transform their hearts, relationships, and mission in the city.

**Leader Self-Reflection Question:**
> Do I consistently see Christ and the Gospel as central in my own study, teaching, and decisions, or am I prone to moralism or program-focus?

---

#### 1.3 Are there clear pathways and practices that facilitate ongoing Gospel renewal?

**Rating Scale:**

1. **No awareness of Gospel power:** The church primarily relies on rules, moral exhortation, or cultural pressure; the Gospel is rarely presented as the power for transformation.

2. **Gospel is acknowledged, but not lived:** Leaders and members can articulate the Gospel intellectually, but there are few practices to apply it, and sanctification is mostly left to effort or morality.

3. **Gospel rhythms exist:** The church has regular rhythms of study, prayer, and community that point members to the Gospel as the source of heart transformation, though participation and understanding are uneven.

4. **Intentional Gospel frameworks:** Clear pathways, small groups, mentoring, and teaching consistently help members understand and experience the Gospel as the power for sanctification — a third way beyond religion and irreligion.

5. **Gospel-centered multiplication:** Mature members and leaders actively coach and disciple others, modeling and multiplying the third-way Gospel lifestyle where repentance and faith continually renew hearts, producing joy, obedience, and witness.

**Leader Self-Reflection Question:**
> How am I personally experiencing the Gospel as the power for my own heart transformation? Are the rhythms and practices I model pointing me toward grace or merely performance?

---

### 2) Worship, Preaching, Sacraments/Ordinances

#### 2.1 Is there consistent weekly corporate worship that invites members to glorify God and make the Gospel clear and near?

**Rating Scale:**

1. **Irregular or perfunctory gatherings:** Worship happens sporadically, and little attention is given to presenting the Gospel clearly or inviting authentic praise.

2. **Weekly but underdeveloped:** Worship and preaching occur each week, but the Gospel is not consistently made central, and corporate worship does not fully engage hearts or equip members for life.

3. **Meaningful and transformative:** Worship is regular and rich; the Gospel is clearly presented in music, prayer, and preaching, drawing 70–80% of members into authentic worship and reflection.

4. **Lives visibly transformed:** Members consistently respond to the Gospel in worship, showing growth in obedience, joy, and relational love; worship shapes personal and communal life throughout the week.

5. **Gospel-saturated, participatory culture:** Worship is vibrant, participatory, and forms disciples; many members serve, minister, and embody the Gospel both on Sundays and in daily life, experiencing Christ as near and powerful in the corporate gathering.

**Leader Self-Reflection Question:**
> How is the Gospel shaping my heart in worship each week? Am I personally encountering Christ's grace as I lead, or am I merely facilitating others' worship?

---

#### 2.2 Are sound, expository, Gospel-centered and contextual sermons preached weekly?

**Rating Scale:**

1. **Developing and inconsistent:** Preaching occasionally conveys truth, but the Gospel is not consistently central, and exposition is weak or uneven.

2. **Mostly Gospel-centered:** Sermons are generally expository and Gospel-focused, but lapses occur; application to life and culture may be limited or unclear.

3. **Consistently high-quality:** Sermons regularly present the Gospel clearly, faithfully interpreting Scripture in context and applying it to everyday life.

4. **Transformative preaching:** Weekly sermons shape hearts and behaviors, leading to repentance, faith, and obedience; they engage both believers and non-believers with cultural relevance.

5. **Multiplying preachers:** The church has intentional pathways to train new preachers in expository, Gospel-centered, and contextual preaching, ensuring the same standard of heart-transforming proclamation continues.

**Leader Self-Reflection Question:**
> As I prepare and preach, do I sense my own heart being renewed by the Gospel? Or am I driven more by craft, approval, or performance?

---

#### 2.3 Are the sacraments/ordinances of baptism and the Lord's Supper practised regularly and meaningfully?

**Rating Scale:**

1. **Irregular or unclear practice:** Sacraments are infrequent, poorly explained, or treated as mere tradition without connecting to Christ's work.

2. **Practiced but shallow:** Baptism and the Lord's Supper are observed, yet their significance as signs of the Gospel and grace are not fully communicated or understood.

3. **Gospel-centered participation:** Members regularly partake with a clear understanding that these ordinances display Christ's death, resurrection, and ongoing work in their lives.

4. **Transformation evident:** Observance leads to repentance, faith, gratitude, and practical obedience; lives are visibly shaped by the grace these signs proclaim.

5. **Integrated into Gospel life and community:** The sacraments are practiced with robust theology, accompanied by pastoral care and loving discipline; they nurture personal holiness, mutual accountability, and Gospel-centered community.

**Leader Self-Reflection Question:**
> How deeply does the Gospel engage my own heart when I lead or participate in baptism and the Lord's Supper? Do these ordinances move me toward repentance, gratitude, and joy?

---

### 3) Primacy of Prayer

#### 3.1 Do elders and leaders enjoy and model a vibrant, Gospel-centered prayer life?

**Rating Scale:**

1. **Minimal and perfunctory:** Prayer occurs mainly in crises or as a formal duty; leaders do not model dependence on God's grace.

3. **Joyful practice:** Elders delight in prayer, intercede regularly, and model dependence on the Gospel for personal holiness and ministry effectiveness.

4. **Spiritually formative leadership:** Leaders' prayer life visibly strengthens the church; it shapes vision, pastoral care, and members' engagement with the Gospel.

5. **Multiplying disciples through prayer:** Leaders intentionally disciple others into deep, Gospel-centered prayer, embedding rhythms and practices that transform the hearts of members and leaders alike.

**Leader Self-Reflection Question:**
> How is the Gospel drawing me into private prayer? Am I dependent on Christ, or am I approaching prayer as duty or habit?

---

#### 3.2 Is prayer a regular and joyful part of everyday church life?

**Rating Scale:**

1. **Irregular and reactive:** Prayer happens only occasionally, usually in emergencies, and is not a central part of life or ministry.

2. **Regular but functional:** Prayer occurs consistently, but often as a duty or formality rather than a joyful engagement with God's grace.

3. **Gospel-infused rhythms:** Planned and spontaneous prayer are common across ministries, reflecting awareness of Christ's work and dependence on the Spirit.

4. **Heart-and-life shaping:** Prayer includes lament, intercession, adoration, and thanksgiving, forming hearts that reflect the Gospel and shaping everyday decisions, relationships, and mission.

5. **Integrated Gospel culture:** Private, family, small group, and corporate prayers are all vibrant, joyful, and deeply connected to Christ's saving work; the church breathes together in constant communion with God.

**Leader Self-Reflection Question:**
> How regularly and joyfully do I commune with God in prayer? When prayer feels dry, do I turn again to the Gospel or drift into duty or indifference?

---

#### 3.3 Are members being invited and equipped for a true and rich prayer life?

**Rating Scale:**

1. **Prayer is incidental:** Members rarely think about prayer, and there is little guidance or encouragement.

3. **Gospel-shaped habit:** Members engage in authentic, Spirit-empowered prayer that reflects reliance on Christ's work rather than legalistic effort.

4. **Intentional pathways:** Structured rhythms, small groups, and Gospel-centered communities nurture corporate and individual prayer, encouraging growth in dependence and delight in God.

5. **Discipleship multiplication:** Elders, staff, and lay leaders actively mentor, train, and coach members in vibrant prayer, modeling Gospel-centered dependence and equipping others to do the same in their daily lives.

## Framework Summary

This framework provides a comprehensive assessment tool for evaluating church health through a Gospel-centered lens. Each question is designed to help churches and leaders:

1. **Assess current reality** honestly and prayerfully
2. **Identify areas of strength** where the Gospel is flourishing
3. **Recognize areas needing renewal** where the Gospel needs to be more central
4. **Reflect personally** on how the Gospel is shaping leadership
5. **Plan for growth** in Gospel-centered health and mission

The framework emphasizes that this is not about performance or comparison, but about grace, transformation, and the beautiful, believable witness of the Gospel in both the church and the city.
